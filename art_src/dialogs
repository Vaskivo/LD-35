S - This is Shape

c - Good, you arrived at your destination.
c - Do you remember your assignment?

s - Yeah. Terrorists infiltrated a military facility.
s - They plan to lauch a nuke and dominate the world.

c - This a one-man mission to inflitrate and kill all terrorists.
c - However, this is <big>shaping</> up to be a tricky mission.

s - How so?

c - The terrorist were injected with special nanomachines
c - that change their body.

s - How to I take care of that?

c - You, yourself, can steal their modifications for yourself
c - changing your body.

s - Huh! That is handy.

c - There is only one caveat. You can only kill enemies with one less
c - or one more side that you have.
c - So if are a square, you can only kill triangles and pentagons.

s - Thats a bummer.

c - And remember you become the <big>shape</> of the enemy you killed.
c - So remember this the order:
c - Circle, triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon.

s - Ok, got it.

c - One more time:
c - Circle, triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon.

s - Yeah, yeah. I got it.

c - Ok, Shape. Carry on with the mission.
c - And good luck.

s - Thanks.
